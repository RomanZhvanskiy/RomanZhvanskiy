### Greetings! 
I am a fresh from Le Wagon school data scientist looking to apply data science methodologies to solve everyday real - life business problems.

In the previous life, I was a senior consultant providing inputs on fire & gas detector mapping and computational fluid dynamics studies to inform quantitative risk assessments, mostly for oil & gas industry but also for anything else that can burn, release flammable or toxic gas or explode.  
I have a Ph. D. in Computational Fluid Dynamics and an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from Imperial College London.

Top technical highlights:

Main studies:
Le Wagon 2023: Bootcamp in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
